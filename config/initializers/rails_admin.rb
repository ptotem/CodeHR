  ################  Global configuration  ################

  # Set the admin name here (optional second array element will appear in red). For example:
  config.main_app_name = ['Code HR', 'Admin']
  # or for a more dynamic name:
  # config.main_app_name = Proc.new { |controller| [Rails.application.engine_name.titleize, controller.params['action'].titleize] }

  # RailsAdmin may need a way to know who the current user is]
  config.current_user_method { current_user } # auto-generated
  config.authorize_with :cancan
  # If you want to track changes on your models:
  # config.audit_with :history, 'AdminUser'

  # Or with a PaperTrail: (you need to install it first)
  # config.audit_with :paper_trail, 'AdminUser'

  # Display empty fields in show views:
  # config.compact_show_view = false

  # Number of default rows per-page:
  # config.default_items_per_page = 20

  # Exclude specific models (keep the others):
  # config.excluded_models = ['AdminUser', 'ApprovalMat', 'BandMaster', 'CandEducation', 'CandidateContactNumber', 'CandidateEmploymentHistory', 'CandidateFamilyDetail', 'CandidateMaster', 'CandidatePersonelAddress', 'CommunicationAddress', 'CompanyAddress', 'CompanyMaster', 'CompensationComponent', 'ConditionStmt', 'ContactPerson', 'CustomCondition', 'CustomRule', 'DocumentMaster', 'DocumentTemplateMaster', 'DynamicField', 'Education', 'EmailDetail', 'EmployeeMaster', 'EmploymentHist', 'EsisNomination', 'FamilyDetail', 'FormulaList', 'GroupMaster', 'InterviewType', 'InterviewerList', 'JobDescriptionMaster', 'JobPreference', 'LocationPreference', 'MailBcc', 'MailCc', 'MailTo', 'ManpowerPlanning', 'NotificationDetail', 'NotificationMaster', 'PfNomination', 'ProcessMaster', 'Qualification', 'Rating', 'RatingScale', 'Receiver', 'ReportingTo', 'Role', 'RuleAction', 'SalaryComponentMaster', 'Scale', 'ScoreReceived', 'Step', 'StepMaster', 'User', 'VacancyMaster', 'VacancyScheduling', 'Vaddress', 'VendorMaster']

  ################  Model configuration  ################

  # Each model configuration can alternatively:
  #   - stay here in a `config.model 'ModelName' do ... end` block
  #   - go in the model definition file in a `rails_admin do ... end` block

  # This is your choice to make:
  #   - This initializer is loaded once at startup (modifications will show up when restarting the application) but all RailsAdmin configuration would stay in one place.
  #   - Models are reloaded at each request in development mode (when modified), which may smooth your RailsAdmin development workflow.


  # Now you probably need to tour the wiki a bit: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki
  # Anyway, here is how RailsAdmin saw your application's models when you ran the initializer:
